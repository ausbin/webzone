My Hugo Website
===============

This is the statically-generated portion of my website, written using
[Hugo][1].

Getting Started
---------------

After cloning the repository and [installing hugo][2], run `hugo` to generate
the site, and `hugo serve` to run a temporary HTTP server at
<http://localhost:1313/>. (Pages served by the latter auto-refresh while you're
working; it's super convenient)

Tricks
------

### Atomically re-generating the site when pushing to the repo

When I push to a repository on the server hosting my site, it re-generates
automatically! I wrote [a blog post][3] with more details.

### Including recent git commits

The homepage includes recent commits I've made using content generated by a
quick C program I wrote named gustave ([github][4], [cgit][5]). Using a similar
strategy as above, whenever I push to any of my repositories, a git
post-receive hook runs, running gustave and then hugo to re-generate the site.

See [my blog post][6] for more information.

*Note: as of October 2022, I removed recent commits from the front page of my
website for career-change reasons, but if you want to see what the recent
commits listing used to look like, [you can try the Internet Archive][7].*

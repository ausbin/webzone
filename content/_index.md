Hi, I'm Austin Adams, a PhD student at the [Georgia Institute of Technology][1]
studying compilers and programming languages for quantum computers. I am
co-advised by [Tom Conte][11] and [Jeff Young][12], and you can find my
publications [listed here][5]. Right now, my main project is [the Qwerty
quantum programming language][19].

I got my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2018 and my Master of
Science in Computer Science in 2022, both from Georgia Tech. My master's thesis
was titled [_Enabling a Programming Environment for an Experimental Ion Trap
Quantum Testbed_][16], which involved hacking on the [QCOR][13]/[XACC][14]
compilation framework(s). Between finishing master's and starting PhD, I
interned at Microsoft and worked on [the Q# compiler][15].

I have been the head TA of both CS 2110 and CS 4290/6290, the undergrad and
grad intro to computer architecture courses at Georgia Tech. I have also been
an instructor (of record) for CS 2110 twice. Here's some [praise from student
evaluations][9] across all my time TAing and teaching.

During the ~2 years between undergrad and grad school, I lived in Seattle and
worked as a software engineer on product ingestion into the [Amazon][10]
catalog. (For more information on the inner workings of the Amazon catalog,
[see this article][18].)

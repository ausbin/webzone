In an [earlier article specific to OpenVPN][1], I wrote:

This article covers the same idea,  except for Cisco AnyConnect VPNs
using [OpenConnect][3], a libre implementation of AnyConnect. (I haven't
tried the official nonfree client, but I'm assuming it's not worth the
trouble, for this purpose at least.)

First, I use the same `netns@.service` [systemd service][4] I wrote in
[the OpenVPN article][1] by putting it in `/etc/systemd/system/`:

    [Unit]
    Description=network namespace %I

    [Service]
    Type=oneshot
    ExecStart=/bin/ip netns add %I
    ExecStop=/bin/ip netns del %I
    RemainAfterExit=yes

By putting network namespace creation/deletion in a separate unit
(rather than a script launched by OpenConnect/OpenVPN at connection
time), the VPN uses the same network namespace across restarts. For
example, if I have a browser running in a VPN namespace and restart my
VPN client, my browser doesn't stay in an outdated netns after my VPN
client starts up, creates a new netns, and changes the netns to which
`/var/run/netns/X` points.

I also created an `openconnect@.service`, which depends on
`netns@.service`:

    [Unit]
    Description=OpenConnect VPN Connection: Profile %I
    Requires=network.target netns@%i.service
    After=network.target netns@%i.service
    
    [Service]
    Type=simple
    WorkingDirectory=/usr/local/etc/openconnect/
    ExecStart=/usr/local/etc/openconnect/openconnect-wrapper %I

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

Notice that it executes `openconnect-wrapper`, a wrapper shell script,
which I (arbitrarily) chose to put in `/usr/local/etc/openconnect/`.
Here it is:

    #!/bin/bash
    set -e
    
    [[ -z $1 ]] && {
        printf "$0: usage: $0 <preset>\n" >&2
        exit 1
    }
    preset="$1"
    
    [[ ! -f $preset.conf ]] && {
        printf "$0: error: '$(pwd)/$preset.conf' does not exist!\n" >&2
        exit 2
    }
    
    # Expect the hostname to be the first line in the file, immediately
    # preceded by `# '
    host="$(head -n 1 "$preset.conf" | cut -b 3-)"
    pass="$(cat "$preset.pass" || systemd-ask-password "Password for AnyConnect VPN $preset:")"
    
    # vpnc-script-netns expects this to be set
    export NETNS="$preset"
    exec openconnect --config "$preset.conf" --script ./vpnc-script-netns --passwd-on-stdin --non-inter "$host" <<<"$pass"

I wrote the script to allow me to have presets for different servers. It
reads the hostname from the first line of the config file (after `#` and
a space) and calls [`systemd-ask-password`][5] to ask for the password
so that I don't have to write my password in plaintext anywhere. (When
you start the service, you can enter the password by running
[`systemd-tty-ask-password-agent`][6] as root.)

Here's my configuration file for Georgia Tech's VPN, `gatech.conf` (the wrapper script
reads the comment at the top to determine the hostname):

    # https://anyc.vpn.gatech.edu
    authgroup=gatech
    user=aadams80

The wrapper script also tells OpenConnect to configure the network
interfaces using `vpnc-script-netns`, another shell script I hacked
together:

    #!/bin/bash
    set -e
    
    [[ -z $NETNS ]] && {
        printf "$0"': $NETNS is not set! Please set it to the name of the desired namespace\n' >&2
        exit 1
    }
    
    case $reason in
        connect)
            ip netns exec "$NETNS" ip link set dev lo up
            ip link set dev "$TUNDEV" up netns "$NETNS" mtu "$INTERNAL_IP4_MTU"
            # Setup only IPv4 for now
            ip netns exec "$NETNS" ip addr add "$INTERNAL_IP4_ADDRESS" dev "$TUNDEV"
            ip netns exec "$NETNS" ip route add default dev "$TUNDEV"
    
            # Put DNS servers in /etc/netns/$NETNS/resolv.conf
            mkdir -p "/etc/netns/$NETNS"
            {
                printf '# Generated by vpnc-script-netns\n'
                for dns_server in $INTERNAL_IP4_DNS; do
                    printf 'nameserver %s\n' "$dns_server"
                done
            } >"/etc/netns/$NETNS/resolv.conf"
        ;;
    esac

Currently, it handles only IPv4 because my university's VPN
doesn't appear to support IPv6 yet.

I guess that's it. With a config file named `gatech.conf` in the same
directory as `vpnc-script-netns` and `openconnect-wrapper`, I start the
VPN with:

    # systemctl start openconnect@gatech
    # systemd-tty-password-agent
    Password for AnyConnect VPN gatech: ***********************

and then run applications in it like:

    $ nsdo gatech firefox

Or, using [iproute2][8] instead of [nsdo][2]:

    # ip netns exec gatech sudo -u $USER firefox

Or using `nsenter` from [util-linux][7]:

    # nsenter -n/var/run/netns/gatech sudo -u $USER firefox

Preventing Inactivity Timeouts
------------------------------

After a period of inactivity, the Georgia Tech VPN will close my
connection. To prevent this, I just leave an instance of `ping` running
in the namespace:

    $ nsdo gatech ping -i 60 gatech.edu &

But that could easily be a systemd unit, so I'll try to update this post
later with one.

In CS 2110 at Georgia Tech, we use the Gameboy Advance to demonstrate
how C code can interact directly with hardware. On a high level,
students create games by reading button states directly from
memory-mapped registers and write directly to a special region of memory
called the "video buffer," which the video controller continuously reads
and draws on the screen.

But my favorite example of students poking with the GBA hardware
introduces them to an important real-life example: [Direct Memory Access
(DMA)][2]! The GBA has a DMA controller which amounts to a fast `memcpy()`
in hardware which some additional switches to flip. ([See tonc for more
details on GBA DMA][1].)

Students use DMA as follows:

```c
// provided boilerplate
typedef struct {
	const volatile void *src;
	volatile void *dst;
	volatile uint32_t cnt;
} DMA_CONTROLLER;

#define DMA ((volatile DMA_CONTROLLER *) 0x040000B0)

#define DMA_DST_INC (0 << 21)
#define DMA_DST_DEC (1 << 21)
#define DMA_DST_FIX (2 << 21)

#define DMA_SRC_INC (0 << 23)
#define DMA_SRC_DEC (1 << 23)
#define DMA_SRC_FIX (2 << 23)

#define DMA_ON (1 << 31)

// STUDENT CODE:
// Turns the whole screen red
void redscreen(void) {
    volatile u16 color = RED;
    DMA[3].src = &color;
    DMA[3].dst = videoBuffer;
    // dimensions of gba screen
    DMA[3].cnt = DMA_ON | DMA_SRC_FIX | DMA_DST_INC | (240 * 160);
}
```

Notice that the student code above which invokes DMA does not call a
function we can mock out in an autograder, like how a student's
`malloc()` could call a fake `sbrk()` --- it's just hitting memory at
some weird address.

You might think: well this is easy you dingus, just make the
`DMA` macro point to some chunk of memory which you can check after
their code returns! However, GBA DMA normally stops the CPU
while it makes the copy, and that would not. Let's
look at a less trivial example of DMA:

```
void redsquare(int width, int height) {
    volatile u16 color = RED;
    for (int row = 0; row < height; row++) {
        DMA[3].src = &color;
        DMA[3].dst = videoBuffer + row * 240;
        // dimensions of gba screen
        DMA[3].cnt = DMA_ON | DMA_SRC_FIX | DMA_DST_INC | width;
    }
}
```

If we used the "magic DMA buffer" idea mentioned above, later DMA
transfers would clobber src/dst/cnt values from earlier transfers. That
is, we would only see the DMA results for the last row of the red
square. So that ain't gonna work.

Consequently, before this semester, we never autograded DMA. Instead, we
would `grep` students' code for `for` loops to see if they were
manipulating the videoBuffer pixel-by-pixel[^^1] without DMA and then
would make sure the emulator showed the right image. But my goal in 2110 is
to autograde as much as possible (especially because TAs would be
grading the timed lab during or right before their final exams), so I
decided to take this opportunity to flex so hard I caused permanent
muscle damage.

Abusing Virtual Memory to Solve Your Life Problems
==================================================

What's a good way to make a memory access halt execution of a program,
much like how setting the `DMA_ON` bit in the control register makes the
DMA controller halt the CPU while the copy runs? A page fault!

We can make DMA accesses pagefault by making the DMA macro point to some
page marked as unwritable in the page table. Then our page fault handler
runs and can read what they wrote! Except it's not that simple: when an
instruction pagefaults, it doesn't actually _run_, so we can't see what
students wrote to our fake DMA page. In other words, we can see what
address the student tried to hit, but not what they wrote (yet). So
instead, our page fault handler needs to mark the fake DMA page as
writable in the page table, so that when the hardware re-tries the
faulting instruction, it actually has an effect.

But this re-introduces the original problem: how do we know what they
wrote? Indeed, if our page fault handler makes the fake DMA page
subsequently writable, then later DMA accesses won't pagefault, meaning
we'll miss them and they'll clobber the written data in the fake DMA
page. We're back to square one!

My solution was to use two fake DMA pages and alternate between them.
The DMA macro always points to an unwritable page, but when an
instruction faults, we change the page it's trying to hit to writable.
(Changing the page to which the DMA macro points will not change the
page that the faulting instruction hits when the hardware retries the
instruction because the old page will still be in some register,
unchanged.) This solves our problem because every DMA access will
pagefault, and we can see the data that the user wrote on DMA access $t$
when DMA access $t+1$ pagefaults.

So the pseudocode for the tester would look like:

    page fault handler:
        make sure this is a fake DMA-related page fault
        read what the student wrote to the fake DMA page on
            the last faulting access. log it
        mark the page to which the DMA macro points as
            writable so the faulting instruction can run
        set the DMA macro to point to the alternate page and
            set it as unwritable

    tester code:
        set up page fault handler
        run student code
        check fake DMA page for data written by student on
            the final access
        exit

A visualization for all this follows:

{{< figure src="/img/blog/autograding-gba-dma/dma2.png" alt="DMA virtual memory hack diagram" width="100%" >}}

On Linux, you can map pages with `mmap()`, change their permissions with
`mprotect()`, and catch page faults by registering a `SIGSEGV` handler.

Simulating DMA
==============

Simulating DMA seems simple enough. When the the segfault handler or
cleanup code reads what the student wrote to the fake DMA page, we see
if they set the `DMA_ON` bit in the control register, and if they did,
simulate it!

But there's a complication here too. Returning to the earlier example,

```c
void redscreen(void) {
    volatile u16 color = RED;
    DMA[3].src = &color;
    DMA[3].dst = videoBuffer;
    DMA[3].cnt = DMA_ON | DMA_SRC_FIX | 38400;
}
```

we see the student (correctly) sets the source register to the address
of a variable on the stack. But we can only check to see that they set
`DMA_ON` in the control register _after_ their function returns because
there are no later fake DMA segfaults --- this is true for the last DMA
access in general. But accessing memory in the stack frame of a function
which has returned is undefined behavior in C, because it's gonna get
clobbered by subsequent function calls! Yikes!

Speculative Copying, aka Copy Like a Madman
-------------------------------------------

The instant the user sets the `DMA_ON` bit in the control register, we
need to take a snapshot of memory around where the source register
points. However, we have a few problems with when this copy needs to
happen:

 1. We only know they're writing to the control register, not that
    they're setting the `DMA_ON` bit
 2. Similarly, we don't know how much they're copying
 3. We don't how if they're using source decrement or source increment.
    (Source decrement means subtracting 2, or 4 if 32-bit DMAing is
     enabled, from the source address instead of adding after
     each one of the `N` transfers.)

We can fix all three of these issues by simply copying super
aggressively when the user sets the control register, even if we don't
know what flags they set or size they requested. In particular, if they
copy more than 38,400 pixels (shorts), they're doing the problem wrong
anyway (since that's bigger than the actual videoBuffer!), so that
provides an upper bound. And to handle source decrement, we can copy the
76,800 bytes on the left-hand and right-hand side of the source pointer,
just in case.

But now we have a new problem: what if, for example, they're using
source decrement and they set the source pointer near the end of the
heap? Then we're gonna segfault when trying to "snapshot" memory. The
hack I found is to `fork()` and then copy until failure. Pseudocode:

    zero out source buffer

    fork()
        copy left-hand side of src pointer byte-by-byte
            until I segfault, stopping at the max copy size

    fork()
        copy right-hand side of src pointer byte-by-byte
            until I segfault, stopping at the max copy size

    wait()
    wait()

So if _they_ copy too far, instead of a segfault in the mystery tester,
they'll get black pixels (note the zeroing out of the source buffer at
the top).

This approach seems like it would be slow because of the sheer amount of
copying, but it actually seems to perform pretty well. ðŸ¤·

The Autograding Part
====================

Now that we've got GBA DMA to _work_ on x86, we still have to autograde
it. How? Let's make up an assignment in which the student simply draws
an image in the top left of the GBA screen. That is, they have to complete:

```
void drawImage3(const u16 *image, int width, int height) {
    // Student writes this code
    for (int r = 0; r < height; r++) {
        DMA[3].src = image + width * r;
        DMA[3].dst = videoBuffer + 240 * r;
        DMA[3].cnt = DMA_ON | width;
    }
}
```

What exactly is "right" here? Is this

```
void drawImage3(const u16 *image, int width, int height) {
    for (int r = 0; r < height; r++)
        for (int c = 0; c < width; c++)
            videoBuffer[240 * r + c] = image[width * r + c];
}
```

"right"? Probably not if the assignment is about DMA, but it deserves
some partial credit if it works. How about this

```
void drawImage3(const u16 *image, int width, int height) {
    for (int r = 0; r < height; r++) {
        for (int c = 0; c < width; c++) {
            DMA[3].src = image + width * r + c;
            DMA[3].dst = videoBuffer + 240 * r + c;
            DMA[3].cnt = DMA_ON | 1;
        }
    }
}
```

or this

```
void drawImage3(const u16 *image, int width, int height) {
    for (int r = height - 1; r >= 0; r++) {
        DMA[3].src = image + width * r + width - 1;
        DMA[3].dst = videoBuffer + 240 * r + width - 1;
        DMA[3].cnt = DMA_ON | DMA_SRC_DEC | DMA_DST_DEC | width;
    }
}
```

strange example? I settled on the following:

 1. Require they use DMA to draw pixels on the screen
 2. Require they use the minimum number of DMA calls possible without
    violating #1
 3. For each test input, have two separate tests:
    1. One simulates DMA and tests that the videoBuffer is correct. This
       awards credit for not using DMA or misusing it (e.g. the
       single-pixel DMA example above) but still getting it working
    2. The other compares the log of DMA calls with the expected, but
       does its best to allow perfectly valid cases like the
       double-decrementing one right above even though it does
       everything backwards from the simpler approach

Regions of the Screen
---------------------

For the second test above, I ended up taking the log of their DMA calls
and converting each call to a generalized form of some ordered
quadruplet $(i\_\text{start}, i\_\text{end}, v\_\text{start}, v\_\text{end})
\in \mathbb{Z}^4$, where the first two coordinates are the start/end
indices in the image of the copy, and the next two are the same except
for the videoBuffer.

Then I normalized each copy in both the actual and expected lists of
copies using the following two steps: First, if $i\_\text{start} >
i\_\text{end}$ for any transfer $(i\_\text{start}, i\_\text{end},
v\_\text{start}, v\_\text{end})$, then I converted the quadruplet to
$(i\_\text{end}, i\_\text{start}, v\_\text{end}, v\_\text{start})$ since
that represents the same copy. Then I sorted the list of copies by start
index.

After normalizing both the actual and expected copies, I can compare
them copy-by-copy in order and display a (hopefully) helpful error
message to the student on the first one that does not match.

Example Tester
==============

If you're interested, [the GitHub repository for all this DMA stuff][4]
has a complete example of a tester which uses the strategies I rambled
about above. Beware, the student half, which runs a GBA emulator,
requires the CS 2110 GBA toolchain, but that's not really the fun part
--- the grader is!

[^^1]: One student infamously evaded our `grep` checking by [unrolling their loop][3] by hand. That's hundreds of lines and we loved it

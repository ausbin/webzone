Hi, I'm Austin Adams, a PhD student at the [Georgia Institute of
Technology][1] studying quantum computing from a computer architecture
perspective. I am co-advised by [Tom Conte][11] and [Jeff Young][12], and you
can find my publications [listed here][5].

I am particularly interested in architecture and compilation techniques for ion
trap quantum computers and hybrid quantum--classical programming. I have
experience hacking on both the [Q#][15] compiler and the [QCOR][13]/[XACC][14]
compilation framework(s).

I graduated from Georgia Tech in 2018 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer
Science. As an undergrad, I worked as the head teaching assistant for CS 2110,
the undergraduate intro to computer architecture course at Georgia Tech where I
wrote a [bunch][6] [of][17] [autograders][8].

In 2022, I also completed my Master of Science in Computer Science from Georgia
Tech. My master's thesis was titled [_Enabling a Programming Environment for an
Experimental Ion Trap Quantum Testbed_][16]. During my master's, I was the head
TA for CS 6290, the graduate intro to computer architecture course at Georgia
Tech that covers topics such as branch prediction and out-of-order execution.
Here's some [praise from student evaluations][9] across all my time TAing.

Between undergrad and grad school, I worked for [Amazon][10] in Seattle,
Washington, for about 2 years on some backend retail code.

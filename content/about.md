Hi, I'm Austin Adams, a junior in Computer Science at the [Georgia
Institute of Technology][1]. Since I enjoy low-level work and computer
science theory, I chose the Theory and Systems & Architecture
[threads][2], and I expect to graduate in Fall 2018.

Previously, I attended [Kennesaw State University][3] for two years, one
of which was full time in my senior year of high school through the [Dual
Enrollment Honors Program][4].

Today, I work as an undergraduate teaching assistant for CS 2110, the
intro to C and assembly class at Georgia Tech. I get to help students
write recursive assembly, malloc() implementations, and Game Boy Advance
games â€” it's fun! I'm also a founding member of the [Young Democratic
Socialists of America at Georgia Tech][6], a leftist organization on
campus.

Professionally, I've worked on both GNU/Linux and Windows applications,
from shell scripts to ASP.NET MVC, but in my free time, I write tools
for GNU/Linux, mainly command-line utilities and webapps. See my
[projects page][5] for details.

Hi, I'm Austin Adams, a PhD student at the [Georgia Institute of
Technology][1] studying quantum computing from a computer architecture
perspective. My advisor is [Tom Conte][11].

I graduated from Georgia Tech in 2018 with a Bachelor of Science in
Computer Science. Previously, I had attended [Kennesaw State
University][3] for two years, one of which was full time in my senior
year of high school through the [Dual Enrollment Honors Program][4].

The highlight of my time as an undergraduate was working as the head
teaching assistant for CS 2110, the intro to computer architecture
course at Georgia Tech. When I wasn't answering emails, I spent a bunch
of time writing autograders for [digital logic circuits][6], assembly
code, malloc() implementations, and even [Gameboy Advance DMA][8].
Here's some [praise from student evaluations][9].

After graduation, I worked for [Amazon][10] in Seattle, Washington, for
a little under 2 years on a great team who maintained bulk product
uploads to Vendor Central. I haven't worked on programming projects much
lately, but you can see some of my past projects on my [projects
page][5].

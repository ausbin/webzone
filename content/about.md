Hi, I'm Austin Adams, a recent graduate of the [Georgia Institute of
Technology][1] with a Bachelors in Computer Science. Previously, I
attended [Kennesaw State University][3] for two years, one of which was
full time in my senior year of high school through the [Dual Enrollment
Honors Program][4].

The highlight of my college career was working as the head teaching
assistant for CS 2110, the intro to computer architecture course at
Georgia Tech. When I wasn't managing the team of undergraduate TAs or
answering emails, I spent a bunch of time writing autograders for
[digital logic circuits][6], assembly code, malloc() implementations,
and even [Gameboy Advance DMA][8]. Here's some [praise from student
evaluations][9].

Professionally, I've worked on both GNU/Linux and Windows applications,
from shell scripts to ASP.NET MVC, but in my free time, I write tools
for GNU/Linux, mainly command-line utilities and webapps. See my
[projects page][5] for details.
